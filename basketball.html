    <h3>RULES OF BASKETBALL</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.
        </li>
        <li>
            The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass.
        </li>
        <li>
            <UL>The ball must stay in bounds</UL> If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball.
        </li>
