     <h1>RULES OF WFC</h1>

     <ul>
        <li>
            Licenses: All participants, including fencers, coaches, and referees, must have an EFC license. National federations are responsible for entering participants. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Referee quotas: The number of referees required depends on the number of fencers competing. For example, 1–3 fencers require no referee, while 10–15 fencers require 2 referees. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Competition formats: Competitions often include one or two rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination table. 
        </li>
